=== Entry_1 ===
I wasn't supposed to go this far. I'm not even sure this is the same planet.

Where am I? When am I? Where is everyone? A.V.E.R.I. won't give me a straight answer. It's just us out here. 
All alone.

Ecological rehabilitation and topography surveyance is going about as well as can be expected. I wish I could get in contact with the Company. 
That last storm really did a number on the ship, it's in need of some repairs. 
On the bright side, I'm getting more used to this planet's odd gravity, the legs...to A.V.E.R.I. 
I went through the presaved entertainment content pretty quickly, but A.V.E.R.I. has apparently been equipped with improvisational code. 
I've been talking to them alot.

Saw something in the distance...I can't tell if it's a landscape formation, and there isn't an active belay beacon close enough for A.V.E.R.I. to analyze. It almost looked like...buildings? 
Want/need to investigate further.
