=== Fungus ===
These structures are approximately the size of sequoia trees with capped canopies. They appear sturdy enough to climb. Sample analyzation is required for more information.
    -> Flora_D1

=== Ferns ===
Leafy, frond structures. Not very stable, but dense. Extremely responsive to day/night cycles. Sample analyzation is required for more information. 
    -> Flora_D1
    
=== Grass === 
Short stalks, clustered in large open plains. Sample analyzation is required for more information. 
    -> Flora_D1

=== Terrain_D1 ===
To further survey SOV S4's topography, A.V.E.R.I. has identified several prime sites for the placement of belay beacons. 
Traverse to these points, install, and activate these beacons to map and access further areas of the planet.
