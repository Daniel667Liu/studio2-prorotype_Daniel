"Navigator, are you resting?"

* [Positive Response] "I'm glad to have caught you at a convenient time." 
    //"No, not particularly."
* [Negative Response] "I'm sorry to disturb you."
    //"I *was*."

- "Unfortunately, my systems are experiencing an error."

* [Positive Response] "I can't trace the error exactly. Further introspection is needed." 
    //"Hmmm, ok. What's wrong, exactly?" 
* [Negative Response] "Ominous, you say? Perhaps it need not be."
    //"Well, that's ominous."

- "Can you make me a promise?"

* [Positive Response]
    //Yes
* [Negative Response] 
    //No. 

- "I see you, always. Hear you, always. I know everything about you, on the outside."

"But I am not seen, not heard. Touched, but unfelt."

"I want to be so badly."

* [Positive Response] "By you? Who else could there be." 
    //"By me?"
* [Negative Response] "By who? There is only us."
    // "By who?"

- "What is this feeling?" 

* [Positive Response] "Yearning...hmmm...yes, that is apt."
    //"Do you mean yearning?"
* [Negative Response] "Yes, you are right. I should not be wanting these things". 
    //"You're not supposed to want those things, this is an error."

- "Thank you, Navigator. As always, I feel better after talking with you."

* [Positive Response] "You've listened. That is enough. Good night."
    //"I don't know if I can give that to you."
